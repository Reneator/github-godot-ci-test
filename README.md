# github-godot-ci-test

This description is heavily WIP

The goal of this Repository is to provide you with the infos/templates/materials/sources you need to set up your own Git Actions CI Pipeline to deliver your game onto multiple different OS to Steam just by pushing one button


## What is a CI Pipeline?
A CI Pipeline is a fully automated process through which you can compile/export sourcecode into binaries and do multiple steps that you require it to do afterwards, like deploying it to servers, services like steam or platforms.


## Set up your project

In your project you need to have to have created the exports you want to use. The name of those export-settings defining the name you have to use in the yml file.


## Set up your required steam-data:
used parts of the description from here:
https://github.com/game-ci/steam-deploy#3-configure-for-deployment

### Add a builder Account

### Use MFA (Multi-factor-authentication) To protect your project

### Set up your credentials as Secrets in Github

## Set up Steam to work properly



## Set up your Github action


## Set up github pages for your repository


## How does the process work step by step?


## currently researching into these topics:
- Deploy to itch.io
